<strong> Talk Title: </strong> A Tale of Two Applications of Verification in Machine Learning
     <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> The rise of machine learning, particularly in the form of deep learning, has created a qualitative shift in our conception of what software is and what software can accomplish. But, of course, it’s not all rainbows and butterflies. Researchers have been hard at work trying to understand the fragility of the machine-learning pipeline: from training to inference, small changes to the input can result in radical changes to the output, which can lead to security, safety, as well as ethical problems. In this talk, I will show how new techniques from software verification can help us reason about, and ensure, robustness of machine-learning techniques against training-time (poisoning) and test-time (adversarial-example) attacks.
<br/>
This talk is based on joint work with Yuhao Zhang, Samuel Drews, and Loris D’Antoni.

      <strong> Bio: </strong> Aws Albarghouthi is an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He studies automated synthesis and verification of programs. He received his PhD from the University of Toronto in 2015. He has received a number of best-paper awards for his work (at FSE, UIST, and FAST), an NSF CAREER award, a Google Faculty Research Award, and Facebook Research Awards. Aws is very excited about his virtual visit to Waterloo.

<strong> Talk Title: </strong> Understanding and Repairing Deep Neural Networks
     <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied to a wide variety of problems, including image recognition, natural-language processing, medical diagnosis, and self-driving cars. As the accuracy of DNNs has increased so has their complexity and size, making the outputs of such models difficult to meaningfully interpret. The talk describes a new symbolic representation for DNNs that allowed us to exactly compute the integrated gradients, a state-of-the-art network attribution method that until now has only been approximated.

Moreover, DNNs are far from infallible, and mistakes made by DNNs have led to loss of life, motivating research on verification and testing to find mistakes in DNNs. In contrast, the talk describes techniques and tools for repairing a trained DNN once a mistake has been discovered. We present Provable Repair of DNNs, which computes a minimal change to the parameters of a trained DNN to correct its behavior according to a given specification, and ensures that the patch is provably effective, generalizing, local, and efficient.
