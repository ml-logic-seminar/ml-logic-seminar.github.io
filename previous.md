      <strong> Talk Title: </strong> A Tale of Two Applications of Verification in Machine Learning
      <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> The rise of machine learning, particularly in the form of deep learning, has created a qualitative shift in our conception of what software is and what software can accomplish. But, of course, it’s not all rainbows and butterflies. Researchers have been hard at work trying to understand the fragility of the machine-learning pipeline: from training to inference, small changes to the input can result in radical changes to the output, which can lead to security, safety, as well as ethical problems. In this talk, I will show how new techniques from software verification can help us reason about, and ensure, robustness of machine-learning techniques against training-time (poisoning) and test-time (adversarial-example) attacks.
<br/>
This talk is based on joint work with Yuhao Zhang, Samuel Drews, and Loris D’Antoni.

<strong> Talk Title: </strong> Understanding and Repairing Deep Neural Networks
     <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied to a wide variety of problems, including image recognition, natural-language processing, medical diagnosis, and self-driving cars. As the accuracy of DNNs has increased so has their complexity and size, making the outputs of such models difficult to meaningfully interpret. The talk describes a new symbolic representation for DNNs that allowed us to exactly compute the integrated gradients, a state-of-the-art network attribution method that until now has only been approximated.

Moreover, DNNs are far from infallible, and mistakes made by DNNs have led to loss of life, motivating research on verification and testing to find mistakes in DNNs. In contrast, the talk describes techniques and tools for repairing a trained DNN once a mistake has been discovered. We present Provable Repair of DNNs, which computes a minimal change to the parameters of a trained DNN to correct its behavior according to a given specification, and ensures that the patch is provably effective, generalizing, local, and efficient.

      <strong> Talk Title:  What does it mean for ML to be trustworthy? </strong>
     <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> The attack surface of machine learning is large: training data can be poisoned, predictions manipulated using adversarial examples, models exploited to reveal sensitive information contained in training data, etc. This is in large parts due to the absence of security and privacy considerations in the design of ML algorithms. Yet, adversaries have clear incentives to target these systems. Thus, there is a need to ensure that computer systems that rely on ML are trustworthy. Fortunately, we are at a turning point where ML is still being adopted, which creates a rare opportunity to address the shortcomings of the technology before it is widely deployed. Designing secure ML requires that we have a solid understanding as to what we expect legitimate model behavior to look like. We structure our discussion around two directions, which we believe are likely to lead to significant progress. The first encompasses a spectrum of approaches to verification and admission control, which is a prerequisite to enable fail-safe defaults in machine learning systems. The second pursues formal frameworks for security and privacy in machine learning, which we argue should strive to align machine learning goals such as generalization with security and privacy desiderata like robustness or privacy. We illustrate these directions with recent work on adversarial examples, privacy-preserving ML, machine unlearning, and deepfakes.

<strong> Talk Title: Robustness in unsupervised and supervised machine learning </strong>
     <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> Recently, the need for robust machine learning algorithms has become apparent. Whether due to errors in data collection, model misspecification, or adversarial attacks, contaminated datasets arise in many areas. This is an issue, as existing methods appear to be quite brittle to small amounts of errors. Even more worryingly, these models are being deployed in many security-critical settings, such as self-driving cars, where reliability is an absolute must. In this talk, I will describe a line of work in which we provide provable guarantees for robust machine learning in several fundamental settings. I’ll begin by discussing the problem of robust estimation of mean and covariance of a Gaussian distribution, and how to relax this to distributions with weaker assumptions on the moments. I will then describe how these methods can be used to “robustify” supervised learning algorithms by applying robust mean estimation algorithms to the gradients of the dataset. While theoretically sound, the algorithms are also realizable and efficient, and I will present experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data. Based on joint works with Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Jerry Li,
Ankur Moitra, Jacob Steinhardt, and Alistair Stewart.

    <strong> Talk Title: Certified Artificial Intelligence </strong>
     <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> Despite surpassing human-level performance in many challenging domains such as vision, planning, and natural sciences, there remain concerns about the fragility of modern data-driven AI systems when applied in the real-world, which poses a threat to their wider adoption. Indeed, obtaining AI systems theoretically guaranteed to be safe and reliable is a fundamental challenge of critical importance. In this talk, Gagandeep will present a path towards addressing this fundamental problem. Specifically, He will introduce new mathematical methods combining convex optimization with the classical abstract interpretation framework that enables scalable and precise logical reasoning about the (potentially infinite number of) behaviors of an AI system (e.g., a deep neural network). He will then show how these methods enable both the creation of state-of-the-art automated verifiers for modern AI systems and the design of new provable training techniques. Finally, He will outline several promising future research directions.
      <br>
      <strong> Bio: </strong> Gagandeep Singh will be starting as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) from Fall 2021.

    <strong> Talk Title: Towards  ML for Quantification in SMT </strong>
     <br>
         <strong> Abstract: </strong> We aim to use ML to guide quantifier instantiation in SMT solving. What is the motivation for this? Quantifiers are indispensable in logic-based modeling, yet infamously hard to reason about. It can already be shown that exponential speedups are obtained by clever instantiation of quantifiers in finite domains. We will look at this in the context of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF). Further, we will look at the use of ML in the context of finite first-order models.  The second part of the talk will outline how ML can help in general SMT  quantifier instantiation and what ML methods are applicable in this domain.

<strong> Talk Title: Formal Verification for Neural Networks and Cyber-Physical Systems with Reachability Methods </strong>
     <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> Neural Networks have made great advances in vision and game-playing in the last decade. Beyond these core areas, however, almost every other field has at least attempted to use neural networks to some extent. Cyber-physical systems (CPS), where computers interact with the physical world, are no different. Although learning-based controllers have long been looked at in control theory, recent interest in combining CPS with neural networks has soared. One important distinction with CPS, however, is that these systems are not confined to the digital world. Behaviors of a neural network in a CPS may manifest in the physical world. CPS are often safety-critical and cannot tolerate any mistakes.
<br>
The field of formal verification has traditionally looked at proving properties about finite state machines or software programs. Recent research has also looked at other classes of systems such as CPS models given with differential equations, or even systems that include neural networks. This talk reviews some of our research in these areas, as well as results from the first international verification competition for neural networks (VNN-COMP) which took place last July. For a set of neural networks that performs automated aircraft collision avoidance, our nnenum tool was both the fastest and the only one to successfully prove all of the formal properties in the competition.
      <br>
