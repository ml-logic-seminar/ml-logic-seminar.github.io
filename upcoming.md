<strong> Talk Title: Formal Verification for Neural Networks and Cyber-Physical Systems with Reachability Methods </strong>
     <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> Neural Networks have made great advances in vision and game-playing in the last decade. Beyond these core areas, however, almost every other field has at least attempted to use neural networks to some extent. Cyber-physical systems (CPS), where computers interact with the physical world, are no different. Although learning-based controllers have long been looked at in control theory, recent interest in combining CPS with neural networks has soared. One important distinction with CPS, however, is that these systems are not confined to the digital world. Behaviors of a neural network in a CPS may manifest in the physical world. CPS are often safety-critical and cannot tolerate any mistakes.
<br>
The field of formal verification has traditionally looked at proving properties about finite state machines or software programs. Recent research has also looked at other classes of systems such as CPS models given with differential equations, or even systems that include neural networks. This talk reviews some of our research in these areas, as well as results from the first international verification competition for neural networks (VNN-COMP) which took place last July. For a set of neural networks that performs automated aircraft collision avoidance, our nnenum tool was both the fastest and the only one to successfully prove all of the formal properties in the competition.

      <strong> Bio: </strong> Stanley Bak is a computer scientist investigating the verification of autonomy, cyber-physical systems, and neural networks. He strives to develop practical formal methods that are both scalable and useful, which demands developing new theory, programming efficient tools and building experimental systems.
<br>
Stanley Bak received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 2007 (summa cum laude), and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2009. He completed his PhD from the Department of Computer Science at UIUC in 2013. He received the Founders Award of Excellence for his undergraduate research at RPI in 2004, the Debra and Ira Cohen Graduate Fellowship from UIUC twice, in 2008 and 2009, and was awarded the Science, Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholarship from 2009 to 2013. From 2013 to 2018, Stanley was a Research Computer Scientist at the US Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), both in the Information Directorate in Rome, NY, and in the Aerospace Systems Directorate in Dayton, OH. He helped run Safe Sky Analytics, a research consulting company investigating verification and autonomous systems, and performed teaching at Georgetown University before joining Stony Brook University as an assistant professor in Fall 2020.

<strong> Talk Title: Fairness, Explainability, and Privacy in AI/ML Systems</strong>
     <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> How do we develop machine learning models and systems taking fairness, accuracy, explainability, and transparency into account? How do we protect the privacy of users when building large-scale AI based systems? Model fairness and explainability and protection of user privacy are considered prerequisites for building trust and adoption of AI systems in high stakes domains such as lending and healthcare requiring reliability, safety, and fairness.
<br>
We will first motivate the need for adopting a “fairness, explainability, and privacy by design” approach when developing AI/ML models and systems for different consumer and enterprise applications from the societal, regulatory, customer, end-user, and model developer perspectives. We will then focus on the application of fairness-aware ML, explainable AI, and privacy-preserving AI techniques in practice through industry case studies. We will discuss the sociotechnical dimensions and practical challenges, and conclude with the key takeaways and open challenges.
