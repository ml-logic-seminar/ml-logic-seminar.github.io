      <strong> Talk Title:  Majority-3SAT (and Related Problems) in Polynomial Time </strong>
      <br>
      <strong> Abstract: </strong> Majority-SAT is the problem of determining whether an input n-variable formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) has at least 2^(n-1) satisfying assignments. Majority-SAT and related problems have been studied extensively in various AI communities interested in the complexity of probabilistic planning and inference. Although Majority-SAT has been known to be PP-complete for over 40 years, the complexity of a natural variant has remained open: Majority-kSAT, where the input CNF formula is restricted to have clause width at most k.
      <br>
      In recent work, joint with Ryan Williams, we prove that for every k, Majority-kSAT is in P. In fact, for any positive integer k and rational ρ in (0,1) with bounded denominator, we present an algorithm which determines whether a given k-CNF has at least ρ2^n satisfying assignments, in deterministic linear time (whereas the previous best-known algorithm ran in exponential time). 
      <br>
      In this talk we give an overview of the main ideas behind these algorithms, and highlight the implications for some additional problems related to counting satisfying assignments.
